## How to adapt sponsors

This process is in two parts: 

1. Adding a sponsor image
2. Modifying the code in the index.html file.

### Adding a sponsor image

- Surf to the following address : 

```
https://github.com/timeandspace-scotland/timeandspace_website
```

You must be logged in to do this. Make sure that you are on the tab "code", and not the "pull request", "actions" or any other.



- **Click on the folder called "assets" **

This folder holds some code and the images. 



- **Click on the folder called "img"**

![screenshot of the img folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timeandspace-scotland/timeandspace_website/master/assets/img/screenshots/img_folder.jpg)

In this folder is where we put all the images that we link to within the website. This is where you should upload a new logo.



- **Click on the "upload" button to upload a new sponsor logo.**

This takes you to a page where you can upload an image.



- **Click on the "choose your files" text in blue.**

This will open up a window that allows you to browse through your computer to search for the image of the new sponsor's logo. Choose the image you wish to upload. 

Take good note of the filename of your image. **Do not use spaces in the filename**.

Then we need to save our changes. On this platform this is done through something called a "commit".



- **Commit the image you just uploaded.**

You need to add some text describing what changes you just did. In this example, I wrote that I added an image for a new sponsor. 
Then, press "commit changes". 

You should see a spinning icon saying "processing your files" then get back to the overview of the code. 

You can always check if your file has been uploaded correctly by clicking through the folders.
