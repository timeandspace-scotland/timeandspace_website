            <p>Donations towards Time and Space can be made through our Go Fund Me page which you can
            find by clicking the link below.  </p> 
            
            <button class="py-2 my-3" onclick="window.location.href ='https://www.gofundme.com/f/time-and-space-support-group';">Make a donation to time and space</button> 
            
            <p class="mb-3 mt-3">Previously we had a text donation service but this is no
        longer active.  The text donation was set up in memory of Ross MacIntyre Barton, who sadly passed away age 20 in January 2014. While we no longer have the number to text, we did not want to lose his
            story from our site so it can still be read below.</p>

            <p class="mb-3">A donation in memory is a very special way to remember a loved one
            and it helps us to continue to provide support for our members.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-3">Ross' family chose Time and Space to donate to in Ross' memory as
            they wanted a local charity which rethinks mental illness and felt
            instinctively that this was the right choice. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="story" class="py-3 px-3">

            <p class="mb-2"> We read some profiles on The Hearing Voices Network and saw
            that what they <i>[Time and Space]</i> do makes a big difference to people's lives in
            helping them to live and cope with complex mental health
            problems.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-2">Ross had a dual diagnosis, which is both mental health and substance
            use disorder. His condition grew steadily worse during 2013 as the
            condition is very difficult to treat. Ross believed that he was
            possessed. He was unable to live the life he wanted, he wanted to be
            free to write his mind without the little side tracking voice in his
            head. I feel that he would have benefitted from attending the young
            person's voices group that started in November 2013.</p>
            <!-- 
                <p><a href="">Follow this link</a> to learn more about Ross' condition.</p>
            -->
            <p>Ross was in and out of hospital over the past year and felt it
            did nothing for him.  He had strong feelings about the service
            including that hospital food should have more healthy choices and
            that in mental health hospitals there should be more for people to
            do.  He felt that therapy should be given more one to one and there
            is too much reliance on drugs and not enough listening and
            discussion.  He felt imprisoned and wanted one to one counselling
            and to be involved with discussion groups.   All this made Ross
            uncooperative with the doctors who were trying to help him.
